Under the purview of Shawn to help out Christian with SCA scanning for former network assets.

Script needed to parse the settings.xml file and output the required data in another XML file.

Script needs to accomodate other pkg managers as well besides Maven, like NPM, Gradle, etc.

McGinn asked me to try to implement separate try-catch blocks while extracting each element. Tried doing that but getting few errors. That's something that can be fixed later. The script works right now as is.

Comments get extracted as well if they are inside the element. Otherwise not.
